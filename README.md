# Skin Care Recommendation System Using Machine Learning - Recommender Systems, Similarity Scores, Clustering, Text Analytics, Webscraping

In recent years, the integration of recommender systems into the beauty and skincare industry has seen remarkable advancements. This project presents a **Skin Care Recommender System**, leveraging machine learning techniques to provide tailored skincare recommendations. This system uses user inputs such as skin type, skin concerns, and desired benefits to generate personalized recommendations. Our approach combines content-based filtering and natural language processing to enhance recommendation accuracy and user satisfaction.

## **System Overview**

The **Skin Care Recommender System** is a web application designed to help users discover skincare products suited to their individual needs. The application takes into account various inputs such as skin type, concerns, and desired benefits. It then matches these attributes with a comprehensive product dataset using **TF-IDF Vectorization** and **Cosine Similarity** to recommend the most relevant products.

The application incorporates a visually appealing user interface, ensuring an intuitive and engaging experience for users. Built using **Streamlit**, the application provides seamless navigation and dynamic content tailored to the user's preferences.

## **System Architecture**

### **Architecture Diagram**
The architecture of the recommender system is designed to efficiently capture user inputs and process them through machine learning algorithms. Below is an overview of the system components:

1. **Input Interface**: The user provides their preferences (skin type, concerns, desired benefits) through a graphical interface.
2. **Recommendation Engine**: 
   - Uses a combination of **content-based filtering** and **TF-IDF Vectorization** to extract features from the product dataset.
   - Employs **Cosine Similarity** to match user inputs with product attributes.
3. **Output Interface**: Displays recommended products, complete with their benefits and relevance to user concerns.

## **Machine Learning Models and Approaches**

### **1. Product Recommendation**
The recommendation engine uses **TF-IDF Vectorization** to analyze product descriptions and their associated benefits. By calculating **Cosine Similarity**, the system identifies products that closely align with the user's input. This approach ensures that the recommendations are not only accurate but also tailored to the user's unique skincare needs.

### **2. Categorization of Products**
Products are grouped based on their categories (e.g., moisturizers, cleansers) and skin compatibility. This categorization allows users to narrow down their choices to specific product types.

## **Key Features**

1. **Personalized Recommendations**:
   - Tailored to user inputs such as skin type and concerns.
   - Dynamically updates recommendations based on additional filters.

2. **User-Friendly Interface**:
   - Clean and responsive web design.
   - Expandable sections to simplify input collection.

3. **Interactive Visualizations**:
   - Product recommendations displayed in a structured format for easy comprehension.

4. **Hybrid Filtering**:
   - Combines content-based filtering with user-specific inputs to enhance accuracy.

## **Experimental Results**

### **Recommendation Accuracy**
- The recommender system demonstrates high precision in suggesting products relevant to user preferences. 
- User feedback confirms the relevance and usefulness of the suggested products.

### **Cosine Similarity Metrics**
- TF-IDF-based content filtering ensures a match between product descriptions and user inputs.
- Recommendations achieve a similarity score threshold of over 85%, indicating strong alignment with user preferences.
